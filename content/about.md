**T minus T to the Zero** (or ... T minus 1) is a blog about the countdown to zero toil in engineering and operations. We provide technical articles for running modern applications (cloud native, AI pipelines, etc) in production with a focus on automation, MLOps, DevOps, and next generation architectures. We believe in using technology to make technologists' lives easier.
Of *course* computers should do the heavy lifting of running themselves. It should always be that way!

## Who We Are

Tzero is brought to you by the Mirantis Open Source Program Office (OSPO) and the broader engineering community. We're practitioners who have experienced the pain of operational toil firsthand and are passionate about sharing what we've learned.
